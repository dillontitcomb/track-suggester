# _Dillon's Track Selector_

#### JavaScript & JQuery Exercise for Epicodus, 01.12.2018_

_This web page provides visitors with an idea of which programming track at Epicodus might suit their interests. Based on a few simple questions, the page calculates the percent-fit of the visitor to a given programming track._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _On a Mac, run the following command:_
* _open index.html_

## Known Bugs

_No known bugs. The only weak point is the event in which two tracks have the same percentage score. In this case, an alert is triggered, but in a future iteration this problem should be solved by showing both potential tracks or asking a follow-up question to settle the tie._
