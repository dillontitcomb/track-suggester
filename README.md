# _Dillon's Track Selector_

#### JavaScript & JQuery Exercise for Epicodus, 01.12.2018_

#### By _**Dillon Titcomb**_

## Description

_This web page provides visitors with an idea of which programming track at Epicodus might suit their circumstances. Based on a few simple questions, the page calculates the percent-fit of the visitor to a given programming track._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _On a Mac, run the following command:_
* _open index.html_

## Known Bugs

_There is not currently any good solution to two tracks having the same percentage fit. However, more questions and a subsequent growth in score variety will reduce the likelihood of a tie. 

_There aren't currently enough questions for the percentage outputs between 100% and 0% to be particularly interesting. However, the more questions asked, the more meaningful the percentage calculation will get._
